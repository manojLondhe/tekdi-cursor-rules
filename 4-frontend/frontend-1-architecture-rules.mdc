# Frontend Architecture Rules

## SOLID Principles in Components

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each component must have ONE clear, well-defined purpose
- Split components that handle multiple concerns into smaller, focused units
- Name components based on their single responsibility (Button, Modal, UserCard)
- If component description uses "AND", consider splitting it
- Keep business logic separate from UI rendering logic

### Open/Closed Principle
- Design components for extension without modification
- Use composition patterns over inheritance
- Leverage props/attributes for configuration
- Implement plugin/slot patterns for extensibility
- Use CSS custom properties for style customization

### Dependency Inversion
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- Inject dependencies through props or context
- Abstract API calls behind service interfaces
- Use dependency injection for external services

## Component Structure & Organization

### File Organization
- One component per file with descriptive filename
- Co-locate related files (styles, tests, types) in component folders
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project
- Group related components in feature/domain folders
- Keep shared/common components in dedicated directory

### Component Interface Design
- Define clear, minimal prop interfaces
- Use descriptive, semantic property names
- Distinguish between required and optional props
- Provide sensible defaults for optional props
- Document complex prop relationships

### Composition Patterns
- Favor composition over inheritance for component reuse
- Use compound component patterns for complex UI
- Implement render props for behavior sharing
- Create higher-order components for cross-cutting concerns
- Use slots/children for content injection

## Component Data Flow

### Component Communication
- Pass data down through props and attributes
- Use callback functions for upward communication
- Implement clear interfaces between parent and child components
- Avoid deep prop drilling through component hierarchies
- Use context or state management patterns for cross-cutting data

## Component Lifecycle & Side Effects

### Effect Management
- Handle side effects in appropriate lifecycle hooks
- Clean up subscriptions and event listeners
- Avoid memory leaks from uncleaned references
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use cancellation tokens for async operations

### Event Handling
- Use consistent naming for event handlers (onSubmit, handleClick)
- Handle events at the appropriate component level
- Prevent event bubbling when necessary
- Implement proper keyboard event handling
- Clean up event listeners on component unmount

## Component Optimization

### Component Design for Performance
- Design components with minimal re-render impact
- Use proper component boundaries to isolate updates
- Implement efficient component composition patterns
- Design reusable components with performance in mind

## Error Handling

### Component Error Boundaries
- Implement error boundaries at strategic component levels
- Provide fallback UI for component errors
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Allow graceful error recovery when possible
- Avoid cascading failures through proper error isolation

### Input Validation
- Validate props at component boundaries
- Use type systems for compile-time checking
- Implement runtime validation for external data
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Validate data at all entry points
- Use schema validation for complex data structures
- Provide immediate feedback on invalid input
- Sanitize user input before processing
- Implement client-side validation as UX enhancement, not security

## Component Structure Standards

### HTML Structure
- Build components with proper HTML structure foundation
- Follow semantic markup principles in component templates
- Ensure components generate accessible HTML output

## Testing Architecture

### Testable Design
- Design components with testing in mind
- Use dependency injection for external services
- Keep business logic in pure functions
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Focus on component behavior and outputs

### Test Organization
- Co-locate tests with components
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
- Group related tests logically
- Test component integration, not just units
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
